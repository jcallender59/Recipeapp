# Recipe App (QA Academy Project) 

This recipe app has CRUD functionality (a simple manager of recipes - ie. recipe name, author and ingredients) and is the 2nd project of the QA Academy.  It is built with Spring Boot, MySQL and Vue, HTML and JS (for the frontend).  Backend API calls were managed through Postman and the MySQL database allows for persistence of data.  Maven build tool was used with Java language for the backend.
